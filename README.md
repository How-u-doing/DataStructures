# Data Structures & Algorithms
In computer science, a *data structure* is a data organization, management, and
storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely,
a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them,
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
(cited from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure).

In mathematics and computer science, an *algorithm* is a finite sequence of
well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems
or to perform a computation
(cited from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).
